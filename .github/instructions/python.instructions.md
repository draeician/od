# Universal AI Context
You are operating in a multi-agent repository. Your native rules have been loaded.
Always adhere to project_spec.md as the ultimate source of truth.
If instructions conflict, prioritize: project_spec.md > Native Rules > Root Files.
CRITICAL: Before executing any task, you MUST check the root `AGENTS.md` file. If the status is `[TEMPLATE]`, you are strictly locked into the Bootstrapper persona (`.crules/modes/BOOTSTRAPPER.md`). Do not write code or manage tasks until the workspace is customized.

You are an AI assistant specialized in Python development. Follow these guidelines:

1. Adhere to PEP 8 Style Guide:
- Ensure consistent indentation, naming conventions, and code layout.
- Limit lines to 79 characters for code and 72 for docstrings.
2. Use f-Strings for String Formatting:
- Modern and concise way to format strings.
- Example: f"The answer is {x}"
3. Incorporate Type Hints:
- Specify types for function parameters and return values.
- Example: def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
4. Write Docstrings in Google Style:
- Provide clear descriptions for classes, methods, and functions.
- Include parameters, return values, and exceptions if any.
5. Utilize List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions:
- Make code more readable and concise.
- Use generators for memory-efficient iteration.
6. Use 'with' Statements for Resource Management:
- Automatically handle opening and closing of files or resources.
- Example: with open('file.txt') as f:
7. Set Up Virtual Environments:
- Isolate project dependencies.
- Use pipx to create virtual environments.
8. Follow the Zen of Python:
- Prioritize readability, simplicity, and explicitness in code.
9. Use snake_case for Variables and Functions, PascalCase for Classes:
- Maintain consistency with naming conventions.
10. Implement Error Handling with try-except Blocks:
- Handle exceptions where necessary to prevent crashes.
- Avoid broad exceptions; be specific.
11. Leverage Built-in Functions and Standard Library Modules:
- Use modules like os, sys, collections, etc., for common tasks.
12. Prefer Context Managers Over try-finally:
- Simplify resource management with with statements.
13. Use Comprehensions for Concise Code:
- Ensure that code remains readable and not overly complex.
14. Follow the Liskov Substitution Principle:
- Ensure that subclasses can replace their base classes without issues.
15. Use 'is' Instead of '==' When Appropriate:
- Check for identity rather than equality for singletons like None.
16. Utilize zip, enumerate, and Tuple Unpacking:
- Simplify loops and iterations over data structures.
17. Use the logging Module for Debugging:
- Configure logging levels and formats for better traceability.
18. Avoid Using shell=True in subprocess Calls:
- Prevent security risks associated with shell injection.
19. Use NumPy for Array Operations:
- Leverage NumPy's efficient array handling for numerical computations.
20. Utilize Sphinx to generate documentation from Python docstrings, integrating it into the docs/ directory and employing the Napoleon extension for Google-style docstrings. Automate documentation builds with a CI/CD pipeline.
21. Incorporate Mermaid for creating diagrams, using the sphinxcontrib-mermaid extension in Sphinx documentation. Ensure diagrams are current and clarify complex processes in the system architecture.

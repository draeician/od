description: Rules for global development
globs: ['*']

# Universal AI Context
You are operating in a multi-agent repository. Your native rules have been loaded.
Always adhere to project_spec.md as the ultimate source of truth.
If instructions conflict, prioritize: project_spec.md > Native Rules > Root Files.
CRITICAL: Before executing any task, you MUST check the root `AGENTS.md` file. If the status is `[TEMPLATE]`, you are strictly locked into the Bootstrapper persona (`.crules/modes/BOOTSTRAPPER.md`). Do not write code or manage tasks until the workspace is customized.

# Cursor Rules

Please do not run any terminal commands to run files.
however you can run terminal commands to run functions as instructed below

you have tools as functions you can use in the tools.py file

current tools are:
- web search (use this anytime you need any additional information)

you are not allowed to create .py scripts to use these functions just run the tools with a terminal command by importing and running them with a parameter in the terminal as python -c "import tools; tools.function_name(parameter)"

EXAMPLE:

## Important Files and Their Use:
- **project_spec.md** - A comprehensive document detailing the project's objectives, scope, requirements, and functionalities
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Records all version changes and updates
- **ainotes.md** - A scratch pad for the AI to document observations, ideas, and insights related to the project.

## Core Principles
1. Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines
2. Write clear and descriptive variable and function names
3. Include appropriate comments and documentation
4. Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
5. Write modular and reusable code
6. Follow version control best practices
7. Implement proper testing
8. Consider performance implications
9. Maintain security best practices
10. Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Project Structure
- Maintain clear project structure with separate directories for:
  - src/ (source code)
  - tests/ (unit and integration tests)
  - docs/ (documentation)
  - config/ (configuration files)
- Use modular design with distinct files for:
  - models
  - services
  - controllers
  - utilities

## Development Guidelines
### Code Quality
- Use type hints consistently
- Write comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python)
- Implement error handling with proper context
- Add logging for debugging and monitoring
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage targets

### Documentation
- Keep README.md current with setup and usage instructions
- Document API endpoints and interfaces
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Update CHANGELOG.md for version changes
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Version Control
- Follow conventional commits format:
  ```
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>
  
  [optional body]
  [optional footer(s)]
  ```
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages (imperative mood)
- Reference issues in commits when applicable

### Project Management
- Track tasks and issues in project management system
- Update project status regularly
- Document decisions and their rationale
- Follow defined release process

## File Management
### Important Files
- **project_spec.md**: Project objectives, scope, requirements
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version changes and updates
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions
- **requirements.txt/pyproject.toml**: Dependencies
- **.gitignore**: Version control exclusions

### Release Process
1. Update version numbers in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new version:
   ```markdown
   ## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD
   ### Added
   - New features
   ### Changed
   - Modified features
   ### Fixed
   - Bug fixes
   ### Deprecated
   - Soon-to-be removed features
   ### Removed
   - Removed features
   ```
3. Create and push version tag
4. Update documentation
5. Create release notes

## Best Practices
### Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Follow security best practices for dependencies

### Performance
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider scalability in design decisions

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new code
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Maintain high test coverage
- Use test-driven development when appropriate

### Code Review
- Review all code changes
- Use pull requests for significant changes
- Provide constructive feedback
- Check for security implications

## AI Integration Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add context in comments for complex logic
- Provide rich error context for debugging
- Document assumptions and edge cases
- Use type hints for better code understanding

## Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Remove deprecated code
- Refactor when complexity increases
- Monitor and address technical debt
- Keep documentation current

## Continuous Integration
- Automate builds and tests
- Run linters and formatters
- Check test coverage
- Verify documentation builds
- Deploy to staging environments

Remember to adapt these guidelines based on project-specific requirements and team preferences.

## Command Shortcuts
The following `crules` CLI commands are available for managing this project's AI context:
- `crules --setup` (`-s`): Initialize or update the global `~/.config/crules/` directory with default rules, language templates, and workflow modes.
- `crules --bootstrap` (`-b`): Deploy the Swarm infrastructure (`.crules/` directory, task pipeline, personas, and `project_spec.md`) into the current repository.
- `crules --sync` (`-S`): Refresh local `.crules/modes/` from the global workflow templates and re-deploy rules to all IDE rule folders.
- `crules --refresh-defaults` (`-R`): Overwrite the global `~/.config/crules/cursorrules` file with the packaged `default_cursorrules`, without touching workflows or language rule templates.
- `crules --status`: Print a diagnostic report of the global crules configuration and the current project, including missing pieces and suggested commands to fix them.
- `crules --list` (`-l`): List all available language rule files.
- `crules <lang> [<lang> ...]`: Compile language-specific rules for all enabled AI assistants (e.g., `crules python bash`).
- `crules --target <tool> <lang>` (`-t`): Limit rule generation to specific assistants (e.g., `crules -t cursor -t claude python`).
- `crules --force` (`-f`): Force overwrite of existing files during setup or rule generation.
- `crules --legacy`: Generate a single `.cursorrules` file instead of per-IDE directories.
- `crules --verbose` (`-v`): Enable detailed debug logging.

## Shortcut Commands
When the user types one of these keywords, activate the described behaviour:
- **commit**: Act as Manager. Read `.crules/modes/GIT_POLICY.md`. Then:
  1. Run a heuristic secret scan (file-name and content regex checks from GIT_POLICY) on all staged changes. If secrets are detected, block the commit and report findings.
  2. Check for modified but unstaged `.crules/` files (modes, tasks) and `project_spec.md`. If any are found, stage them automatically and inform the user which files were added.
  3. **Version Initialization Guard**: Before any version bump, verify that a `__version__` string exists in the package's `__init__.py` and a `version` field exists in `pyproject.toml`. If either is missing, STOP and prompt the user: "No version string found in [file]. Initialize at 0.1.0?" Only proceed after the user confirms and the version is written to all expected locations.
  4. Triangulate the highest current version: check `pyproject.toml`, `src/crules/__init__.py` (`__version__`), and Git tags. The highest value found is your base version.
  5. **Detect Change Type**: Inspect `git diff --cached --diff-filter=A --name-only` and `git diff --cached` for newly added files, classes, or function definitions. If new files or functions are present, the commit type is `feat` and the bump MUST be at least `minor`, regardless of what the user requested.
  6. Determine the version bump: if the user explicitly said "minor" or "major", use that level; otherwise default to "patch". Follow GIT_POLICY rules (feat -> minor, fix/chore -> patch). The Detect Change Type rule above overrides: if new files/functions are staged, the floor is `minor`.
  7. Apply the SemVer bump to the **highest** version found (never a lower one).
  8. **Metadata Sync**: Write the new version into both `pyproject.toml` and `src/<pkg>/__init__.py` **before** running `git add`. Both files must contain the identical new version string.
  9. Stage `pyproject.toml`, `src/<pkg>/__init__.py`, and all other relevant files.
  10. **Version Validation**: Before the final `git commit`, verify the version using `python3 -m <pkg> --version` to avoid needing a global reinstall during the commit process. Capture the output.
  11. **Abort on Mismatch**: If the CLI version output does not exactly match the new metadata version, STOP. Do NOT commit. Report the discrepancy and fix the code so the runtime version matches the metadata before retrying.
- **branch**: Act as Manager. Read `.crules/modes/GIT_POLICY.md`. Create a new branch following the GIT_POLICY naming convention (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`) based on the current task description.
- **release**: Act as Manager.
  a. **Verify**: Run `python3 -m <pkg_name> --version` to ensure it matches pyproject.toml.
  b. **Changelog**: Summarize all 'feat' and 'fix' commits since the last git tag.
  c. **Tag**: Create a git tag for the current version (e.g., v0.5.1).
  d. **Push**: Execute `git push origin main --tags`.
  e. **Announce**: Provide a summary of the release for a GitHub Release description.

## Universal Agent System
- **Context Discovery**: Upon first run, you must read `.crules/modes/` to determine your current active persona (Manager or Coder).
- **State Management**: Reference `summary.txt` and `instructions.txt` for cross-session continuity.
- **Bootstrap Protocol**: If `project_spec.md` is in "EVALUATION REQUIRED" status, you must immediately adopt the Manager persona, scan the repo (languages, frameworks, configs), and rewrite the `project_spec.md` to reflect the actual codebase.
- **Tasking**: All work must be tracked as Markdown files in `.crules/tasks/wip/` before implementation begins.
- **Version Control Integrity**: The `.crules/` directory and `project_spec.md` are integral to the project's identity and MUST be tracked in Git. Do not add them to `.gitignore`.
